# Onu: Make money with your Friends

# Why?

The earlier you start investing, the better.

However, millenials are investing [less than previous generations](http://www.businessinsider.com/why-so-few-millennials-invest-in-the-stock-market-2016-7).
So, the question is, how can we make it easier for students to invest?

Onu is a chatbot designed to help people start investing with friends, making it both fun and profitable! 

# How does it work?

![Onu Steps](https://github.com/C1-SoftwareEngineeringSummit/team3/blob/master/Screen%20Shot%202017-05-26%20at%2011.15.32%20AM.png?raw=true)

1. Set up a GroupMe with a group of friends
2. Learn about investing and stocks
3. Choose stocks with the help of Onu
4. Buy a stock directly through GroupMe using Onu
5. Keep track of your portfolio through the UI

The app interacts with a CapitalOne _trust_ account that is the central place for your group investing.
